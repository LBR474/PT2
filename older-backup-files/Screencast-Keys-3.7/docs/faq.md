### Failed to get event while the modal operation is running. (e.g. G + X, S + Y, ...)

Try to enable the experimental option *Get Event Aggressively*.  
This option enables you to get events even if the modal operation is running.

This option hacks the internal structure of Blender, so it is now experimental option.  
If you want to use this add-on safely, you should not enable this option.  
But the bug reports are welcomed.

### Auto saving (.blend file) feature is disabled when Screencast Keys add-on is enabled.

Screencast Keys add-on uses the modal operator which continuously runs Blender's background.  
If the modal operator is running, Blender will disable the auto saving (.blend file) feature.  
For this reason, the auto saving feature is disabled when Screencast Keys add-on is enabled.

Screencast Keys has a feature to simulate the auto saving against this issue.  
Try to enable the experimental option *Auto Save*.  
This option enables the auto saving while Screencast Keys add-on is enabled.

This option hacks the internal structure of Blender, so it is now experimental option.  
If you want to use this add-on safely, you should not enable this option.  
But the bug reports are welcomed.
